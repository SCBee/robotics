# arduino-python-template

### Purpose

This is meant to help my friends and myself with having convenient access to a template canvas to work with on our personal robotics projects. Python is an easy-to-learn and versatile language that is capable of powering more complex projects than just the Arduino built-in libraries!

### Method

The Arduino is connected to the PC via USB and the .ino file establishes the Serial Communications between the PC and the Arduino. The Python script already includes the boilerplate required to start sending data to the Arduino. As for what data the Arduino cares about, and what data your PC sends is all up to you! There are infinite possibilities and a long, fun journey ahead!

### Notes

I have included an example case which uses the Mouse_X4 button to control the state of an LED. The Arduino should be connected to the LED circuit via PIN_3, and there should be a resistor in series with the LED.

### Disclaimer

I see myself as a beginner and I learned a lot by making a couple projects. I hope that this template serves you well. Please don't blame me if your Arduino gets fried (this code will definitely not fry your Arduino).

# Python Requirements

- pywin32
- pySerial

# Arduino Requirements

- All libraries should be included in the official installation package for their IDE provided by Arduino.
