# B33Robot

The beginning of my adventures into robotics. The entire experience was incredibly fun and I highly recommend anyone to try it out!

Although this isn't the most useful or technically challenging project possible, I learned more about the hardware / software interface that I am now using on other passion projects like my on-going racing FPV drone design!

#### Code is still supported by current (2021) Arduinos.
