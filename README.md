# Drone

Here you will find my collection of 3D printable drone designs complete with CAD files. There are both large & micro form factor builds.

Note: Your flight controller MCUs (or Arduino Minis), motors/propellers, BT module/antennas, and batteries need to be selected accordingly to the sizes indicated for each design.

### Practice safe piloting by practicing until you are very confident on a simulator. When flying, be safe by making sure there are no nearby pedestrians when flying and perform controlled landings.

I highly suggest beginners and enthusiasts to practice their piloting skills using the many, high-quality simulation software available online. This will make it safer for everyone including you and your drone. You don't want to spend hours building your very first drone just to crash it into a nearby pond, building, and definitely not a person! Check out droneSim Pro and Drone Racing League Simulator to practice!
